# widehub

Github has a fixed width for the main content on all their pages.

This Chrome extension makes the main content have a large percentage width. It is set differently for pages under *blob* and other pages.

## Problems
* It uses javascript to set CSS styles. I could not get the CSS to change in any meaningful way using .css files.
* It uses jquery to set the CSS styles. I could not get plain javascript (style.width=80% for example) to change anything

# Contributing
I would love for anyone to make this better.
